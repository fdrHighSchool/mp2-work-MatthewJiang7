#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following extension:

  * Attach a "-" on their grade if the grade ends in a 0, 1 or 2 (eg: 92 -> A-, 61 -> D-)

    * First, find out the letter grade then if the ones digit higher than 6 add + if ones digit lower than 3 add -


2. Discuss how you would make sure 100 is not misrepresented as an A-.
  * Either check if the grade is 100 or check if %100 = 0

  * If it's F, don't add the +, - or anything lower than an F- wi have -
